## Storyline

In the near future, an enormous asteroid is hurtling towards Earth, threatening to obliterate mankind. The only hope lies in an international coalition of space miners who have discovered that the asteroid is rich in rare minerals. The race is on to mine these resources, amass a fortune, and escape Earth before the asteroid impacts. Each player controls a mining corporation with the goal of achieving a target financial wealth and escaping Earth on an exclusive spaceship.

## Objective

The player who first achieves the target financial wealth and constructs an exclusive spaceship to escape Earth wins the game. The game ends when the asteroid hits Earth, and all players lose if no one has escaped by then.

## Core Mechanics

1. **Resource Mining:**
   - Players control mining drones that extract minerals from the asteroid.
   - Resources include common metals, rare minerals, and valuable crystals.
   - Mining efficiency depends on drone upgrades and mining site locations.

2. **Resource Management:**
   - Players must manage their resources effectively, balancing mining, refining, trading, and upgrading.
   - Players have limited storage capacity and must plan their extraction and trading strategies carefully.

3. **Cashflow and Economy:**
   - Players earn cash by selling resources on a dynamic market influenced by supply and demand.
   - Cashflow is used to fund mining operations, research, and spaceship construction.
   - Prices fluctuate based on players' actions and random events.

4. **Upgrades and Technology:**
   - Players can upgrade their mining drones, storage facilities, and trading capabilities.
   - Research and development unlock advanced technologies and more efficient mining methods.

5. **Construction and Escape:**
   - Players must construct an exclusive spaceship to escape Earth.
   - Construction requires specific resources and time, funded by the player's cashflow.
   - Players must balance between mining for wealth and building their escape ship.

6. **Random Events:**
   - Random events such as asteroid quakes, resource discoveries, and market crashes add unpredictability to the game.
   - Events can significantly impact players' strategies and the gameâ€™s outcome.

3. **Mining and Resource Extraction:**
   - Players send drones to mine selected sites.
   - Mining yields vary based on site richness and drone efficiency.
   - Extracted resources are transported back to the base for processing and storage.

4. **Resource Management and Trading:**
   - Players refine raw materials into valuable goods.
   - Goods can be sold on the market or used for upgrades and construction.
   - Players must monitor market trends to maximize profits from trading.

   - Players need to maintain a steady cashflow to fund ongoing operations and spaceship construction.
   - Balancing expenditure and income is crucial to ensure sufficient funds for essential activities.

6. **Upgrading and Research:**
   - Players invest in research to unlock new technologies.
   - Upgrades enhance mining efficiency, increase storage capacity, and improve trading outcomes.

7. **Building the Escape Ship:**
   - Players allocate resources and cash to construct their escape ship.
   - The ship requires specific components, each with its own resource and cash requirements.
   - Construction phases must be carefully planned to align with cash availability and resource supply.

8. **Random Events:**
